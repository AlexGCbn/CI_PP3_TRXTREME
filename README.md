<summary> CSS </summary>
The W3C CSS Validation Service (Jigsaw) was used to validate CSS code.   
When performing the URI validation, we get 12 errors and many warnings. Those errors and warnings are related to Bootstrap.  
If we perform the code validation, we can see that there are no errors or warnings, as seen in the images below.

### Device and browser testing

The website was tested on the following devices:
* Windows desktop PC (various components) running Windows 10
  * Chrome Version 92.0.4515.159
  * Edge Version 92.0.902.78
* iPhone 12 Pro
  * Safari 
* Various devices from users who tested for feedback

The webpage works great on all devices and browsers that it was tested on.  
Functionality between desktop and mobile remains the same, with the look of the page changing slightly.  
As the website was designed mobile-first, it fits mobile browsers perfectly while also changing to fit a larger screen and occupy more space.
